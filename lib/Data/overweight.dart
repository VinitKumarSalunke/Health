    "content": "Cat-Cow is a transition between two poses. The set provides your spine with a great stretch and strengthens your abdominal muscles. It is a great asana to start with to lose your belly fat. Get on all fours, making sure that your wrists are parallel to your shoulders and your knees are parallel to your hips. Your shins and knees should be hip-width apart. Once you have acquired the position, get into cow pose. Drop your belly towards the ground as you take a deep breath. Ensure that your chin and chest are up while you look towards the ceiling. Remember to keep your shoulder blades broad and away from your ears.\n\nFrom here, you have to slowly move to the cat pose which will require you to suck in your stomach and draw your belly towards your spine. Your back will round-up towards the ceiling, just like a stretching cat. Move your chin towards your chest.\nRepeat this 15 to 20 times."

As you exhale, bend your knees towards your buttocks. Remember your knees should be apart by the distance of the hip. Stretch your hands backwards and hold your ankles. Take a long and deep breath as you draw your thighs upwards. Your chest and head will also lift up. Hold the position and keep breathing softly."
